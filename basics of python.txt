 1. What is Python?
Definition:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax and readability.

Real-Life Example:
Think of Python as a language like English. It‚Äôs easier to communicate with computers using Python, just like using plain language to talk to someone.

üî§ 2. Variables
Definition:
Variables are containers for storing data values.

python
Copy
Edit
name = "John"
age = 25
Real-Life Example:
Like labeling jars in your kitchen:
python
Copy
Edit
sugar_jar = "sugar"
rice_jar = "rice"
üí† 3. Data Types
Definition:
Data types define the type of value a variable holds.

Data Type	Example	Real-Life Analogy
int	10	Counting apples
float	3.14	Measuring milk in liters
str	"hello"	Writing your name
bool	True/False	Is the light ON? Yes or No
list	[1, 2, 3]	Grocery list

‚ûï 4. Operators
Definition:
Operators perform operations on variables and values.

Operator	Example	Meaning	Real-Life Example
+	2 + 3	Addition	Adding scores in a game
-	5 - 2	Subtraction	Deducting expenses
*	3 * 4	Multiplication	Price √ó quantity
/	10 / 2	Division	Sharing equally
==	a == b	Equal to	Is room_temp same as target_temp?

üîÅ 5. Conditional Statements
Definition:
Used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

python
Copy
Edit
temp = 30
if temp > 25:
    print("It's hot!")
else:
    print("It's cool.")
Real-Life Example:
If it rains, take an umbrella. Otherwise, wear sunglasses.

üîÅ 6. Loops
a. for loop
Definition:
Executes a block of code for each item in a sequence.

python
Copy
Edit
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
b. while loop
Definition:
Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

python
Copy
Edit
count = 1
while count <= 3:
    print("Practice!")
    count += 1
Real-Life Example:

for loop: Checking items in a grocery list

while loop: Filling a bottle until it‚Äôs full

üì¶ 7. Functions
Definition:
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

python
Copy
Edit
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name)
greet("Manu")
Real-Life Example:
Microwave has a ‚ÄúReheat‚Äù button ‚Üí You press it, and it reheats every time (reusable).

üì¶ 8. Lists
Definition:
A list is a collection of items in a particular order.

python
Copy
Edit
grocery = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
print(grocery[1])  # Output: eggs
Real-Life Example:
Your shopping list.

üìë 9. Dictionaries
Definition:
Stores data as key-value pairs.

python
Copy
Edit
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])
Real-Life Example:
Your contact book: Name is the key, phone number is the value.

üéØ 10. Input and Output
python
Copy
Edit
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Welcome", name)
Real-Life Example:
ATM asks you for your PIN (input) and shows your balance (output).

üß† 11. Type Conversion
python
Copy
Edit
age = "25"
age = int(age)
Real-Life Example:
Converting litres to millilitres: changing formats.

üêû 12. Error Handling (Try-Except)
Definition:
Used to handle errors and prevent program from crashing.

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
Real-Life Example:
Wearing a helmet when biking ‚Äî a protection mechanism.

üìÇ 13. Modules and Import
Definition:
Modules are Python files with functions you can reuse.

python
Copy
Edit
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
Real-Life Example:
Using a calculator app for square root instead of doing it by hand.

üß™ 14. Real-Life Mini Project Idea
To-Do List App:

python
Copy
Edit
tasks = []
tasks.append("Buy groceries")
tasks.append("Call mom")
print("My To-Do List:")
for task in tasks:
    print(f"- {task}")
